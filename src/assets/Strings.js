    about:
    'I have been in Edinburgh since 2006. Before that, I was a post-doc in Warwick University (Oct 04- Mar 06, working with Nigel Burroughs), and in Oxford University (Oct 02-Sep 04, working in Julia Yeomans\'s group in the Rudolf Peierls Centre for Theoretical Physics).\n' +
        'I am interested in biophysics, active matter, statistical physics and soft condensed matter physics. I have recently written an e-book to popularise the physics of DNA and chromosomes, which is one of the main topics of my research. If interested in this, you can read it by clicking here.'
